# Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for developing a variety of applications, ranging from system software to game development. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C programming language, with additional features such as classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities.

## Key Features

C++ combines low-level programming capabilities with high-level abstractions, making it suitable for both system-level programming and application development. Some key features of C++ include:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ supports the principles of OOP, allowing developers to organize code into classes and objects, promoting modularity and reusability.

- **Efficiency:** C++ provides low-level access to memory, allowing for efficient manipulation of hardware resources. It also supports features like pointers and manual memory management, giving developers fine-grained control over system resources.

- **Standard Template Library (STL):** The STL is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures.

- **Multi-paradigm:** C++ supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms, giving developers flexibility in choosing the best approach for a given task.

## Hello World Example

To give you a taste of C++, here's a simple "Hello World" program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
